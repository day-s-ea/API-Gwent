# API-Gwent

A solid repository which contains the game version of **Gwent's cards** (from The Witcher 3) in img format (.webp and .png) and primarily in JSON format.

The images are classified by background, faction and description type. In addition, there are also icons representing each card's special abilities and combat row. These icons can be added to the basic cards to personalize and facilitate game-building.

The JSON file, instead, contains all the information about each card including: id number (which follows the alphabetical order of the cards), name, description, how many duplicates of that card can be played, deck membership, type, assigned combat row and abilities.

## Credits

None of this would have been possible without the immense passion (and extraordinary patience) of two Witcher fans, [day-s-ea](https://github.com/day-s-ea) and [sara-musuruana](https://github.com/sara-musuruana), who decided to recreate the Gwent game in its original (and best) version, featuring the classic cards.
